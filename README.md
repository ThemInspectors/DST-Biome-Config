# DST-Biome-Config
A World Generation mod for Don't Starve Together.

## What does it do?
This mod adds more presets to worldgen this includes:
* Forest-Only oriented Biome generation
* A slightly modified lightout preset
* Classic Plus
* A preset which you can configure roads and islands.
* Two Lands from Don't Starve Adventure mode.
* Archipelago from Don't Starve Adventure mode.

## Why is it special?
It's the only mod that allows for islands to be generated without completely changing the entire layout of the world.
Or be able to have islands generated with full worldgen capability

## What's next?
I'm currently looking into other worldgen enhancements such as having both juicy and normal berries.
Here's a list of things that I'm currently looking into:
* Both Juicy and Normal berries in a world.
* Changing the layout mode of the forest.
* Adding winter-esque challenge presets.

## Can I copy this mod?
Yes you can, although it must be under the terms of the license for the mod, I'll be happy to tell you more if you want to PM me.
